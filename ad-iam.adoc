Connect your on-premise AD to your Azure Account

Features for Azure AD connect (seamless SSO from on-premise AD to Azure) :
  - Password hash synch - sign-in method, synch hashes of passwords
  - pass-through auth   sign-in method, allows user to use the same password ?
  - federation integration - hybrid env using on-premises AD FS, for cert renewal
  - synchronization - for creating groups,users, other AD objects, ensures that on-prem and cloud data matches
  - health monitoring - provide central location in Azure portal (Azure AD Connect Health)

How to assign resource access rights to users (in Azure):
  Direct assignment
  Group assignment
  Rule-based assignment - the resource owner creates a group and uses a rule to define which users are assigned to the specific resource
  External authority assignment. Access comes from an external source, such as an on-premises directory or a SaaS app.

External Identities in Azure AD allows people outside of your org to access your apps and resources, while letting them sign-in 
   - login from for ex Google or Facebook
   - share apps with external users
   - develop apps intended for other Azure AD tenants (single-tenant or multi-tenant)
   - develop white-labeled apps for consumers and customers (Azure

Azure AD tenant - ? 
 

3 ways to get devices to Azure AD

- Azure AD Registered  (Windows 10/iOS/Android/MacOS)
  - personally owned
  - signed with personal Microsoft or local account

- Azure AD Joined  (Windows 10, Server 2019 VM in Azure)
  - owned by org
  - signed in with Azure AD account belonging to org
  - only in the cloud

- Hybrid Azure AD Joined (Windows 7, 8, 10, Server 2008 or newer)
  - owned by org
  - signed in with Azure AD account belonging to org
  - in cloud + on-premises
   

.h3 RBAC 

role assignment contains:
  - security principal
  - role definition
  - scope

4 fundamental Azure roles:
  

A security principal (who requested the access)
  - user (PA, in Azure AD)
  - group  (in Azure AD)
  - service principal (NPA-kind of)
  - -managed identity (managed by Azure)

Scopes: Management Group -> Subscriptions -> Resource groups -> Resources (VM, keys, etc)

Built in roles:
  - owner
  - contributer (no grant rights, can delete )
  - Reader (ro)
  - User Access Administrator (only Grant)
  
az role definition list   - list all roles in json including permission


Azure Policies - only for ensuring compliance, doesn't restrict actions (also called operations)
  Evaluate state by examination properties on resources that are in Resource Manager and properties of some Resource Provider
Azure roles - for control access


Azure AD roles (for access to AD resources) vs Azure Roles (for Azure Resources)
AD resources:
  - users
  - groups
  - billing
  - licensing
  - Application Registration
  - etc

by default Global Administrator doesn't have access to Azure resources

Classic Adminitstrators types of roles
 Account Administrator (billing owner) - no access to Azure portal
 Service Administrator
 Co-administrator

Azure AD roles
  Global Administrator - build in role with full access to Azure 
  User Administrator - full access to create and manage users
  Billing Administrator - purcheches, manage subscriptions, support tickets
 


ARM (Azure Resource Manager) layers:
 - subscriptions
 - management groups
 - resource groups
 - resource providers
 - resource locks
 - Azure Blueprints
 - Resource Tags
 - Access Control (IAM)
 - RBAC
 - Azure Policies
 - ARM Templates


.h3 Hierarchy

Management Groups -> Subscriptions (billing) -> Resource Groups -> Resources (created by Resource Providers)

Lock can be done on subscription, resource group or resource:
  - CanNotDelete, update is possible
  - ReadOnly


h4. Azure Blueprints

a declarative way to orchestrate the deployment of resource templates and other artifacts such as:
 - Role Assignments
 - Policy Assignments
 - ARM templates
 - Resource Groups

ARM template vs Azure Blueprints

ARM template - only to one subscription, file stored locally, no connection to resources after creation
Azure Blueprints - can create resources in multiple suscription, tracking/auditing to the created resources, file stored in Azure Cosmo DB
  terms:
    blueprint definition - what should be deployed
    blueprint assignment - what was deployed
