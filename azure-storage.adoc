.h3 Blobs

Tyes of blobs
 - Blob blocks - up to 4.75TiB (AWS S3 ?)
 - Append blobs
 - Page blobs - up to 8TB, virtual hard drives (VHD)

Copy data to blobs:
  - AzCopy - cli for linux and windows
  - Azure Storage Data Movement Library - .Net library, uses AzCopy
  - Azure Data Factory - ETL service from Azure
  - Blobfuse - FUSE fs, only Linux
  - Azure Data Box - a device provided by Azure, physically transport
  - Azure Import/Export service - ship your physical disk to Azure (can use both own and microsoft drives - up to 5*8TB - Data Box)
           WAImportExport tool - tool for data preparation

SBM port - 445

.h3 Azure File Synch

An intermediate cache for files

.h4 AzCopy

executable for windows, linux and mac

Required rights
 - Storage Blob Data Reader (for download)
 - Storage Blob Data Contributor
 - Storage Blob Data Owner

ways to login:
  1. Azure Active Directory
  2. Shared Access Signature (SAS) - azcopy login -> page ../devicelogin
    Types of SAS:
     1. account-level
     2. service-level (single storage account) 
     3. user delegation SAS (only for Blobs and Containers), access using AD creds

  Format of SAS (signatuse):
    1. ad-hoc SAS - start, finish time and permission are part of URI - any type
    2. service SAS with stored access policy  (only for blob container, table, queue and file share), can be combined (multiple SAS)

.h4 Azure Storage Explorer

Standalone app for viewing storages/snapshots/operation with files



.h3 Azure Files

Network mounted storage - NFS or SBM (Server Message Block) protocols
Use cases:
 - replaces NAS (Network Attached Storage)
 - "Lift and Shift" (to the cloud)
    - Classic Lift (move application and application data to the cloud)
    - Hybrid Lift (only application data moved, applications are running on-premise)
 - simplify cloud deployment (sharing the same fs across multiple VMs)
 - persistency for containers (docker)

Backups for Azure Files
 - file-based RO snapshots (up to 200)
 - retain for up to 10 years
 - soft delete option (wait some time before actual deletion)

Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) for anomalous activity in storage account

Store tiers:
  - Premium (SSD)
  - Transaction optimized (HDD) - standard
  - Hot - 'optimized for general purpose file sharing schenarios'
  - Cold - HDD, optimized for archiving

Types of storage:
  - General purpose version 2 - HDD
  - FileStorage  - SDD

Identity
  - on-premises (on premise AD Domain Service)
  - managed (Azure AD)
  - Store Account Key - username(storage account name) and password (storage account password) can be used to mount




.h4 Disk comparisons

From [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-types)

| Type          | Max throughput   | Max IOPS  
| ------------- |:----------------:| ---------:|
| Standard HDD      | 500 MB/s | 2000 |
| Standard SSD      | 750 MB/s      | 6000  |
| Premium SSD | 900 MB/s |    20 000 |
| Ultra disk | 2000 MB/s |    160 000 |

All Max size 32TiB

.h5 Ultra disks

Fixed sizes from 4 GiB to 64TiB
Disk IOPS should be less than VM IOPS limit.
Min guaranteed IOPS for  = max(100, size_of_disk/GiB ) IOPS 
throughput =  (provisioned IOPS / 4)  MiB/s
min guaranteed throughput  = max(provisioned IOPS * 4 KiB/s , 1MiB/s)

.h5 Premium SSD

Fixed size from 4GiB to 32TiB
Bursting (credit-based for <= 512GiB  or on-demand for > 512GiB, only in West Central US)
IO operates with blocks 256KiB
performance tier can be changed without changing size

Px (1,2
p1 - 4GiB, 120 IOPS, 25 MB/s,

Max IOPS per disk 3500 (all till P20 512 GiB)
Max burst per disk 170 MB/s (all)
Max burrst duration (per day?) - 30 min
